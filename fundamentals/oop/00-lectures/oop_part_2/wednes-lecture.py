"""
OOP -- THE FOUR PILLARS

Encapsulation --
    grouping code together into these entities we call classes/objects
    

Inheritance

Polymorphism
    Child classes can have different definitions for the same methods, different values for the same attributes by overwriting the values from the parents
Abstraction
    abstraction is an extrension of encapsulation, and we can hide attributes
